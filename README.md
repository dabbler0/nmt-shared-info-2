seq2seq-attn Shared Information and Network Dissection Scripts
==============================================================

To use these scripts you will first need to generate description files using `describe.lua` from here: [https://github.com/dabbler0/nmt-shared-information](https://github.com/dabbler0/nmt-shared-information).

More information on usage in the leading comment of given files. Everything in this repository should now work.

This repository does not currently contain the "masking-out" procedure but should soon. The masking-out procedure will also depend on this altered version of seq2seq-attn.
